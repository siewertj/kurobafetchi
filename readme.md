Introduction
------------

Kurobafetchi is a program that allows batch downloading of images from 4chan through
the command line. It was partly a foray into web scrapping with python. My goal was
to make this as lightweight (ie least amount of external libraries) as possible.


Versioning
----------

I will be following the Semantic Versioning scheme laid out by mr Preston-Werner as
closely as possible. The details of this can be found at http://semver.org/.
