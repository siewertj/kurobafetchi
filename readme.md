CloverFetch is a program that allows batch downloading of images from 4chan through
the command line. It was partly a foray into web scrapping with python. My goal was
to make this as lightweight (ie least amount of external libraries) as possible while
hopefully trying to setup a type of framework for developing future web scrapping apps.
